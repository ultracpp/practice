<h1>C++</h1>
<p>C++ Repository Contains C++ Programming Examples code</p>
<p>all C++ Programs are compiled on Linux through GNU's C++ compiler, Version 11.3.0 </p>
<p>All C++ Code are Compiled as C++23 Standard and most of all Programs are standard C++ Program mean all example contained programs must compile and run similiarly whether you are using Linux, Mac or Windows Because examples are not for any specific Os Related</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<h3>Linux User </h3>
<p>Linux user can install gnu's C++ Compiler and compile all examples, to download and compile the examples follow these steps</p>
<p>STEP 1. Download C++ / G++ Compiler through "apt-get install g++"; command </p>
<p>check whether you download and install g++ compiler successfully or not by entering command g++ --version; this command prints the version </p>
<p> to compile program invoke g++ compiler through following command </p>
<p>g++ <filename.cpp>; </p>
<p>usually g++ compiler generates a.out file after successfully compiled C++ program which can be executed on linux through ./a.out </p>

<p>To compile C++23â€“specific code using g++ or clang++, append the parameter -std=c++20 to the command line </p>
<p>g++  <filename.cpp> -std=c++23; </p>
<p>clang++ <filename.cpp> -std=c++23</p>
