<h1>Dart</h1>
<p>The Dart language is present at the core of the Flutter framework. A modern framework
such as Flutter requires a high-level modern language to be capable of providing the best
experience to the developer and making it possible to create awesome mobile applications.
Understanding Dart is fundamental to working with Flutter; developers need to know the
origins of the Dart language, how the community is working on it, its strengths, and why it
is the chosen programming language to develop with Flutter. In this chapter, you will
review the basics of the Dart language and be provided with some links to resources that
can help you on your Flutter journey. You will review Dart built-in types and operators and
how Dart works with object-oriented programming (OOP). By understanding what the
Dart language provides, you will be able to comfortably experiment with the Dart
environment by yourself and expand your knowledge.</p>
